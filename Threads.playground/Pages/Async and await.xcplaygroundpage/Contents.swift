/*
 Awaiting the async function pauses current execution and frees up the thread (it can be utilized for some other work). Once the async task is completed our original function can continue (not necessarily in the original thread). A regular function must be executed in one go, building up and unwinding its call stack uninterrupted, an asynchronous function does not have this limitation. It’s possible for Swift to take the call stack for an async function and put it aside for a while
 
 We can only call an async function only from a context that is already asynchronous e.g. using Task instance or task modifier (run on show, cancel on remove)
 
 Swift Concurrency ensures that there’s only a certain number of threads spawned in our application. It does this to prevent thread explosion
 
 Task can be created with one of three priorities;
 .userInitiated - default
 .tility
 .background
 */

// await Task.yield() // allow your function to temporarily give up its thread to allow other tasks to make some progress
// try await Task.sleep(for: .seconds(seconds)) // suspends thread for some time

/*
 Task {
 do {
 let fetchedMovies = try await fetchPage(currentPage)
 await MainActor.run {
 // update ui
 }
 } catch {
 // handle the error in some way
 }
 }
 */

/*
 An async function will always run on a background thread unless it was explicitly tied to the main actor
 Awaiting an async function creates a suspension point, this allows the thread that was running your task to make progress on other tasks while you’re suspended
 In SwiftConcurrency, an async function does not run on the thread it was called from. The function itself decides whether it’s run on the main actor or on a background thread
 When an awaited function completes, all of the work that is awaited within that function must also have completed (structured concurrency)
 
 While a task that’s created with the plain Task initializer inherits the actor and task local values from the context it was created in, Task.detached inherits neither of those attributes from its context
 
 Task.detached {
 let userInfo = try await fetchUserInfo()
 }
 
 Tasks have an implicit self capture which means that you can freely use and access members of self inside of a task
 For long tasks, not executed from UI context, one should weakly capture self-reference and define some kind of terminating condition
 
 Task { [weak self] in
 var hasMorePages = true
 var currentPage = 0
 while hasMorePages {
 guard let self = self else {
 return
 }
 let page = await self.networking.fetchPage(currentPage)
 if page.hasMorePages {
 currentPage += 1
 self.items.append(page) } else {
 hasMorePages = false
 }
 }
 }
 
 Task will catch errors automatically without any complaining from the compiler. This can lead to unclear code, so in many cases, it is worth adding a catch block
 
 Task {
 do {
 let userInfo = try await fetchUserInfo() }
 catch {
 // ignore errors...
 }
 }
 
 When you create a task, you can assign the task itself to a property. Your task can then eventually produce a value which we can extract through the task’s value property. Note that even when our task returns nothing, we can access the value property to know when our task completed
 
 let taskOne = Task {
 return try await fetchUserInfo()
 }
 // Compiler error: Property access can throw, but it is not marked 􏰀→ with 'try' and the error is not handled
 let userInfoOne = await taskOne.value
 let taskTwo = Task {
 do {
 return try await fetchUserInfo() }
 catch {
 return nil
 
 }
 }
 let userInfoTwo = await taskTwo.value

// async let will make sure that the child tasks we create complete before our function returns even if we don’t explicitly aswait the result of our network calls. Using an async let will also make sure that cancellationis properly propagated from the parent task to the child tasks that we create

  Up until now you have worked with unstructured and detached tasks. You already know that an unstructured task is created with Task {} and that an unstructured task inherits things like actors and task local values. You also know that you can create a detached task using Task.detached and that a detached task inherits nothing from its creation context.
  
  Neither of these tasks are child tasks of their creation context. Some of the most importantant differences between child tasks and unstructured/detached tasks are the following:
  
  • A child task is cancelled when its parent task is cancelled
  • A parent task cannot complete until its child tasks have completed (either successfully
  or with an error)
  • A cancelled parent task does not stop the child task. Cancellation between parent and
  child tasks is cooperative which means the child task must check for cancellation and
  explicitly respect the cancellation by stopping its work.
  • Priority,actors,and task local values are inherited from the parent task
  The most important rules to understand are the first two on that list. Cancelling a parent task will mark its children as cancelled, and a parent task cannot complete unless its child tasks are completed. This is fully unique to child tasks, and it’s what makes child tasks structured. We’ll dig into this a bit more once we get to the section on structured concurrency.
  The key reason to use an async let is almost never “I want a child task”. Having a child task is more of a result of wanting to perform work in a specific way than a result of literally wanting a child task to exist.
  In the example you saw earlier an async let made sense because:
  • We had two async function calls we wanted to await in parallel
  • The two async functions had no dependencies on each other
  • Our function logicallyc ouldn’t complete unless both async functions completed

// When you’re only interested in the most recent n items that were sent by your AsyncStream, you can give it a buffering policy through its initializer:
// A buffering policy like this is useful when you want to make sure that you always receive the last yielded value (if any) before receiving any new values.
// You can also provide a buffering policy of bufferingNewest(0) which would discard any values that weren’t received by a for loop immediately. This could be a useful buffering policy for an async stream that yields values for events like when the user rotates their device or taps on a button. You’re usually only interested in these kinds of events as soon as they occur but once they’ve occurred they lose all relevance; you wouldn’t want to start iterating over a stream only to be told that the user rotated their device 5 minutes ago; you’ve probably already handled that rotation event somehow.
// It’s also possible to provide numbers other than zero or one for your buffering policy. You might be interested in getting the last four of five values from your stream instead. You can simply provide a number that fits your requirements and you’re good to go.
// In addition to buffering the newest values received by your stream, you can also use a bufferingOldest policy. This will keep the first n values that were not yet received by a for loop, and discard any new values that are received until space opens up in the buffer.
// In addition to the ability to buffer values, an AsyncStream allows us to keep a reference to our continuation outside of the closure that we pass to our AsyncStream initializer. This allows us to yield values for our stream from outside of the initializer. For example, we can yield values in response to certain delegate methods being called on an object that created an AsyncStream and stored the stream’s continuation in a property.

 // While async let is a fantastic tool to perform a handful of tasks in parallel as part of a single parent task or async function, we need a different mechanism to create (and await) any number of tasks.
 // when a child task in a Task Group throws an error, and we allow this error to be thrown from our Task Group closure, the system knows to cancel all of the child tasks, wait for all child tasks to honor their cancellation and complete their work, before the error is actually thrown from the Task Group so we can handle it. If the error would be thrown before all child tasks are completed, that would be a breach of structured concurrency since the parent (the Task Group) would throw an error (and complete) while it still has running child tasks.

/*
 Objects like actors can safely be passed around across concurrency contexts; they were made for that. Other objects like structs, classes, closures, and others are not always safe to pass around. They might hold some non-thread-safe (non-Sendable) state that would make it unsafe to pass an instance of a particular class from one place to the next. However these objects aren’t always unsafe to pass around.
 For example, a struct that doesn’t hold on to any reference types can safely be passed around in our app; after all structs are value types so we’re passing around copies of structs instead of references to a single instance of our struct. A class that only holds immutable state where each property defined on that class is a struct can be safely passed around because there’s no way to get into a data race when it’s impossible to mutate the data that we’re passing around.
 Objects that can be passed across concurrency contexts safely are referred to as Sendable in Swift. Sendable is defined as a protocol in Swift and it has no required properties or methods. It’s a so-called marker protocol that will mark our object as Sendable so that the compiler can check whether our object actually meets all of the requirements for being sendable
 
 To enable strict concurrency checking in your project, navigate to your project’s build settings tab and search for “strict concurrency”. By default, you will find this build setting to have a value of Minimal. As you can imagine, that will perform a very minimal set of constrains like explicit Sendable annotations for example (you will learn about Sendable annotations shortly).
 You could bump the concurrency checks to be Targeted which will enable sendability and actor isolation checks for your project using the same constraints that will be used in Swift 6.0. I would recommend you set this setting to be at least Targeted for existing projects where you want to ensure that your code is as thread safe as possible.
 The third setting is Complete. This will enable the full set of concurrency checks that exists in Swift 6.0. This includes sendability checking, actor isolation checks, and more. For new projects I would recommend you jump straight to setting your checking settings to Complete which will make sure that your code is compatible with Swift 6.0 right away
 
 Let’s take a closer look at all rules that make a value type implicitly conform to Sendable:
 - All members of the struct or enum must be sendable and
 – The struct or enum is marked as frozen or
 – The struct or enum is not public or
 – The struct or enum is not marked as @useableFromInline
 If your struct or enum does not meet all of the above requirements, you can manually add Sendable conformance to tell the compiler to check the sendability for your object.
 
 Classes can be manually marked to conform to the Sendable protocol but there are a few requirements that I’ll dig a bit deeper into in just a moment. Let’s list out the requirements first:
 - A sendable class mustbe final
 - All properties on the class must be sendable and immutable(declared as let)
 - The class cannot have any super classes other than NSObject
 - Classes annotated with @MainActor are implicitly sendable due to their synchronization through the main actor. This is true regardless of the class’ stored properties being mutable or sendable
 
 When you’re certain that you’ve taken the needed steps to ensure that your class is thread safe and fully free of data races you can force the compiler to accept your Sendable confor- mance without actually verifying your conformance by marking your class as @unchecked Sendable
 
 When a closure or function is sendable, the closure or function in question does not capture any non-sendable objects. And because functions and closures do not conform to protocols we declare sendability for these types using the @Sendable annotation
 Annotating a function or closure with @Sendable carries a heavy semantic meaning. It means you intend to use that closure or function in code that is concurrent, and it means that you want to make sure that calling your closure or function is completely thread-safe.

 @Sendable func sampleFunc() {
    // ...
 }
 
 var sample: @Sendable () -> Void = {
 }
