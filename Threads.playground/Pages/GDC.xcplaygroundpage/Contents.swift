/*
 Serial queue runs tasks using single thread - each task must complete before next task is able to start
 Concurrent queue runs tasks using many threads
 
 DispatchQueue.main - serial queue, responsible for UI management
 
 Queue label should be reverse dns name or some meaningful text (its much easier to identify the queue during debbuging), by default created queues are serial
 There is six default concurrent queues, with different quality of service (priority)
 
 QoS:
 .userInteractive - recommended for tasks that the user directly interacts with. UI-updating calculations, animations or anything needed to keep the UI responsive and fast
 .userInitiated - should be used when the user kicks off a task from the UI that needs to happen immediately, but can be done asynchronously
 .utility - for long-running computations, I/O, networking or continuous data feeds. The system tries to balance responsiveness and performance with energy efficiency
 .background - for tasks that the user is not directly aware. They don’t require user interaction and aren’t time sensitive. Prefetching, database maintenance, synchronizing remote servers and performing backups are all great examples. The OS will focus on energy efficiency instead of speed
 .default and .unspecified - should not use explicitly. There’s a .default option, which falls between .userInitiated and .utility and is the default value of the qos argument. It’s not intended for you to directly use. The .unspecified option exists to support legacy APIs
